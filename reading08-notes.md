# Operators and Loops


### ***Expressions and Operators***

*******************

- An **assignment operator** assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand.

- The simple assignment operator is **`=`**, which assigns the value of its right operand to its left operand.

- If a variable refers to an **object**, then the left-hand side of an assignment expression may make assignments to properties of that variable.

- Assignments are used with a variable declaration.

- Assignment expressions evaluate into a result value.

- A **comparison operators** compares its operands and returns a logical value based on whether the comparison is true.
  - The operands can be numerical, string, logical, or object values.

- Strings are compared based on standard lexicographical ordering, using **Unicode** values.

- In most cases, if the two operands are not of the same type, JS attempts to convert them to an appropriate type for the comparison,

### ***Loops and Iteration***

*******************

- **Loops** offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly.

- Can be thought of as a computerized version of the game where you tell someone to take *X* steps in one direction, then *Y* steps in another.

- There are many different kinds of loops, but they all essentially do the same thing; they repeat an action a set number of times.

- A **`for`** loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to **false**

- The **`do...while`** statement repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false

- A **`while`** statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to **true**
