# Reflection and Discussion


### ***Control Flow***

***********************

- The order in which the computer executes statements in a script.

- Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line (unless there are structures that change the control flow).

- A typical script in JavaScript includes many control structures, including **conditionals**, **loops**, and **functions**.
  - Part of a script may also be set to execute when certain events occur.

- Control flow means that when you read a script,you must read from start to finish as well as look at the program structure and how it affects the order of execution.


### ***Functions***

*******************

- A JS Function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task

- Executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).

- A JS function is defined using the **`function`** keyword, followed by a **name**, followed by parenthesis.

- To be executed by the function, the code must be placed inside curly brackets.

- Function **parameters** are listed inside the parenthesis in the function definition.

- Function **arguments** are the values received by the function when it is invoked.
  - Inside the function, these arguments behave as local variables.

- the code insde the function will execute when something **invokes** (calls) the function.

- When JS reaches a **`return`** statement, the function will stop executing.

- Functions often compute a **return value**.

- With functions, you can reuse code, defining it once and using it many times.

- You can use the same code many times with different arguments to produce different results.

- Accessing a function without **()** will return the function object instead of the function result.

- Functions can be used the same way as you use variables.

- Variables declared within a javascript function become **local** to the function.


### ***Operators***

******************

- The assignment operator **`=`** assigns a value to a variable.

- The addition operator **`+`** adds numbers.

- The multiplication operator **`*`** multiplies numbers.

- The addition assignment operator **`+=`** adds a value to a variable.
