### ***Choosing a Text Editor***

**********

In a developer's line of work, choosing the right text editor for you can be a very vital step in the developing process. In short, a text editor is a piece of software (accessed either by downloading onto your device or online) that allows you to write and manage text. Every computer will come with its own built-in text editor, however they are typically bare-bones and as simple as it can get, offering very litle in the way of additional features. While most text editors are the same apart from some minor differences in features, it is important to understand that the best editor for you will be up to your own personal preference and experience. In general, you want to find an editor that you enjoy using and can successfully complete the tasks you are asking of it. With that being said, here are some key features you want to look out for:

1. ***Code Completion***
    - Code completion offers suggestions based on the text you are inputting, saving you time by providing auto-completed choices rather than typing out the full text or command.
    - Some code completion includes the closing of tags or brackets when you open them.
    - You can utilize the shorthand language ***Emmet*** to write your HTML and CSS code more efficiently.

2. ***Syntax Highlighting***
    - Takes the text you input and makes it more noticeable by colorizing it, which makes finding an error in your text much easier.
    - Attributes will be a different color than elements, and elements will be a different color than copy.

3. ***Theme Selection***
    - Themes allow you to do a number of things, from changing the background color of your text editor to changing the series of colors in your text.
    - Find a theme that reduces eye fatigue and strain, most developers opt for a dark background and light text combination.

4. ***Extensions***
    - Extensions are like plugins for your text editor.
    - A text editor with a good selection of extensions will give you the ability to add functionality as needed.
