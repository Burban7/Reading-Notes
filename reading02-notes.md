### ***Choosing a Text Editor***

**********

In a developer's line of work, choosing the right text editor for you can be a very vital step in the developing process. In short, a text editor is a piece of software (accessed either by downloading onto your device or online) that allows you to write and manage text. While most text editors are the same apart from some minor differences in features, it is important to understand that the best editor for you will be up to your own personal preference and experience. In general, you want to find an editor that you enjoy using and can successfully complete the tasks you are asking of it. With that being said, here are some key features you want to look out for:

1. ***Code Completion***
  - Code completion offers suggestions based on the text you are inputting, saving you time by providing auto-completed choices rather than typing out the full text or command.
  - Some code completion includes the closing of tags or brackets when you open them
  - You can utilize the shorthand language ***Emmet*** to write your HTML and CSS code more efficiently
2. ***Syntax Highlighting***
