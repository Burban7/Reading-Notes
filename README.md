# **Growth Mindset**


### ***What is Growth Mindset?***

Growth Mindset refers to a more receptive, open-minded way of thinking and learning. It is often compared against the idea of a "Fixed Mindset," which is a more stubborn, rigid way of thinking. A person who thinks with a Growth Mindset is open to new ideas or new ways of thinking, broadening their horizons and accepting change.  They are persistent and will think outside of the box to come up with creative solutions to problems/obstacles rather than sit in defeat. Those with this mindset will be inspired and motivated in positive ways by the success of others, while those with a Closed Mindset can feel threatened and have negatively-competitive reactions. Especially in the Tech-World, people with the Growth Mindset will be more succesful and thrive.


> "The pessimist sees difficulty in every opportunity. The optimist sees opportunity in every difficulty." -Winston Churchill


### ***Ways to keep yourself in the Growth Mindset?***

1. Ask for help when you need it, one of the best resources you will have in the Tech-World is your peers. Everyone learns and excels in different ways, reaching out can not only help you find a solution to a problem, but also introduce you to new concepts and ways of thinking. Avoid getting trapped by an obstacle due to stubborness or fear of asking for help.
2. Remind yourself that the success of others is not a reflection of your own short-comings or some form of threat. In life, people will excel at things that you struggle with and vice-versa; remember that your path will differ from others. Use the sucess of others to motivate you to reach your own goals, not in the form of negative competition with others, but a positive competition with yourself to reach your goals.
3. Remind Yourself to keep pushing forward, be persistent. Remember that an obstacle is not a brick wall, keep trying and don't give up because something is difficult; you will find a solution in time. If you need some form of competition or motivation, remember that most people will quit when it gets hard. You will succeed where others do not if you put in the work and push yourself.
