# Structuring Web Pages with HTML


### ***Wireframe and Design***

*****************

- Wireframing is a practice used by UX Designers which allows them to define and plan the information hierarchy of their design for a wesbite, app, or product.
  - Focuses on how the designer or client wants the user to process information on a site.

- Wireframes can be created on your computer using different types of software, or just drawn using pen and paper.
  - Pen and paper can be a better starting place for new developers.

- Wireframing is meant to be very bare-bones and strictly the outline of your page design, don't get too carried away with going into fine detail at this point in the process.

- After sketching out your wireframe, you can convert into it into a high-fidelity prototype using online software tools.

- There are three key principles to consider when making a wireframe:
  1. **Clarity**: Your wireframe needs to answer the questions of what the sit epage is, what the user can do there, and if it satisfies their needs. 
  2. **Confidence**: Ease of navigation and predictability in your website will help create user confidence in your brand.
  3. **Simplicity is Key**: Too much information, copy, or links can be distracting to the user. You want a site that makes it easy for the users' to achieve their goals inside the site.


### ***Mozilla HTML Basics***

******************

- **HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)** is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content.
  - Consists of a series of elements which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear or act a certain way.

- There are four main parts of an HTML element:
  1. **The Opening Tag**: Consists of the name of the element wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets **`<>`**
  2. **The Closing Tag**: This is the same as the opening tag, but includes a forward slash before the element name **`</>
  3. **The Content**: This is the content of the element
  4. **The Element**: The opening tag, closing tag, and the content all together make up the element.

- Elements can also have attributes which contain ectra information about the element that you don't want to appear in the element.

- An attribute should always have the following:
  - A space between it and the element name.
  - The attribute name followed by an equal.
  - The attribute value wrapped by opening and closing quotation marks.

- **`<!DOCTYPE html>`** is a required preamble when writing in HTML

- **`<html></html>`** is the HTML element that wraps all the content on the entire page.
  - Also known as the **root element**.

- **`<head></head>`** is the Head element that acts as a container for everything you want to include on the HTML page that isn't the content you are showing to the page's viewers.

- **`<meta charset="utf-8">`** is the element that sets the character set your document should use to UTF-8

- **`<title></title>`** is the Title element that sets the title of ypur page.
  - The title that appears in the browser tab the page is loaded in.

- **`<body></body>`** is the body element which contains all the content that you want to show to web users when they visit your page.


### ***Semantics***

********************

- In programming, **Semantics** refers to the meaning of a piece of code.

- Benefits of writing in semantic markup include:
  - Search engines will consider its contents as important keywords to influence the page's search rankings.
  - Screen readers can use it as a signpost to help visually impaired users navigate a page.
  - Makes finding blocks of meaningful code significantly easier.
  - Suggests to the developer the type of data that will be populated.
  - Semantic naming mirrors proper custom element/component naming.

- Examples of semantic elements:
  - **`<article>`**
  - **`<details>`**
  - **`<figure>`**
  - **`<footer>`**
  - **`<header>`**
  - **`<main>`**
  - **`<nav>`**
  - **`<section>`**
  - **`<time>`**
